    We meet over a zoom meeting to discuss our plan. Chris helped me with a small problem causing me not 
to be able to use node.js. I hadn't installed a couple node modules dependencies. After the meeting I set up 
framework for the page.

    Worked on the formating after Chris added the ability to search and display statistics of artists.

11/13/20
    Implemented album list.

11/19/20
    Implementing the track list to show and hide when clicking on the album took awhile. Eventually I figured it out.
The related artists list was implemented shortly after. I tried to do some animations with it using javascript but it
didn't work. Related artists when clicked on will go to their page.

11/21/20 - 11/22/20
    Added the functionality for the genre's of albums to be added to the genre pie chart but after implmenting it
I learned that the Spotify API doesn't use the genre field that is returned when you get an albums info. 
I tested the function by using an array of strings and it worked then so if Spotify ever ever does use the genre 
field for albums it would work.

    Adjusted index.html so that the "Music Statistics Dashboard" shows before people login. The search button doesn't show up
until after the user logs in. Made it so that Ed Sheeran is the artist displayed when first loaded. Also made it so that when
the page is reloaded the artist that was currently displayed. Had to look up how to use cookies.

11/24/20
    Fixed some accessibility issues. Such as contrast, labels, and alt-text. Also made css changes.

11/25/20
    We tried to get hosting to work on github pages but couldn't because we our dashboard isn't a static page. Chris got it working
with Heroku.

11/27/20
    Worked on some animations. Added arrows onto the buttons that could expand to show tracks in the album list. Tried to
make it so the arrow rotated when the button was clicked on but nothing worked yet.

11/28/20
    Fixed the animation for the arrow rotating when album tracks are expanded and hidden. Changed some css to make the text fit
better when in mobile view. Fixed the issue for related artist's picutres not being uniform size by specifying their height and
and width in css.
